## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- AWS account for hosting services
- MySQL installed or access to Amazon RDS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohanbhadreshpatel/ezcloudstore.git
   cd ezcloudstore
   ```

2. Configure your AWS credentials:
   - Set up an IAM user with the necessary permissions to access S3, RDS, and other services.
   - Add your AWS credentials to your local environment variables.

3. Create a MySQL database:
   - Create a new database in your MySQL instance or Amazon RDS.
   - Update the `application.properties` file with your database connection details.

4. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the user interface at `http://localhost:8080`. Users can sign up, log in, and start uploading files.
